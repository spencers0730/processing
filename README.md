# processing-projects

This is a collection/archive of many projects that I have created in Processing. Most projects are computational art of some sort or visualizations of algorithms.

I will (eventually) port many of my favorite (most of the physics based projects) to [p5js](https://p5js.org) and their own repos, but for now they live here.
