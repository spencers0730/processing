[**Fibonacci Spiral**](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_spiral) is a self-similar spiral that transforms the [**Fibonacci Sequence**](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) into a sequence of squares wrapped around themselves with lengths corresponding to the elements in the Fibonacci Sequence.
